# Final IB Computer Science Project

This was my final project for the International Baccalaureate programme at my High School. Its an application that accesses an online database and fetches a calendar, daily reminders, and finance applications. 

The GUI isn't accessible if the database is unaccesible so the program is non accesable at the moment, though, the code is available and free to use!

Happy Coding!
